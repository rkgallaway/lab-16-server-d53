# AWS Lab

## Links

Here are the two links for the two environments that I set up:

Gamer-Hub: Gamer-Cloud-env.eba-tiski23m.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

AWS-Hub: AWS-Lab-dev.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

## Information

Learned today that AWS has changed since the last time Ryan taught the course and this time around we needed to do the terminal eb init and eb create commands in order to get these two roles we need in order to have our environments be created and the permissions to be there. There is still some work that needs to be done on Amazon's end so that they can fix up ths issues.
